##Blackjack

This is a simple Blackjack game to play in the browser.

##Rules

1. The rules are that the user can Hit and if their score goes above 21 they lose.
2. If they Stand then the dealer must draw cards until their score reaches 17.
3. If the dealer goes over 21 they lose.
4. If they do not go over then the user and dealer's scores are compared to find who is closer to 21.
5. If the user chooses to Double Down then their bet is doubled and they are given one card. Then their score is compared to the dealer's score.

##Objective:
My objective was to create an interactive game that could play multiple rounds.

##Future
Later on I plan to add the option to split the cards. Also to have modals pop-up when someone wins or loses.
